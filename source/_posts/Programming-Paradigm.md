### Generic Programming

> Generic programming centers around the idea of abstracting from concrete, efficient algorithms to obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with different data representations to produce a wide variety of useful software.
>
> — Musser, David R.; Stepanov, Alexander A., Generic Programming

### Functional Programming

> Describe what to do, rather than how to do it。

### Object-oriented programming

> Program to an ‘interface’, not an ‘implementation’.
>
> Favor ‘object composition’ over ‘class inheritance’.



### Program = Logic + Control + Data Structure
